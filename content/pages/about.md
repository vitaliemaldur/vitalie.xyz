Hello, my name is Vitalie. I am a full-stack software engineer based in Bucharest (for the moment). I include in my work
a mix of passion, knowledge, responsibility, and commitment, to be as helpful as I can for the teams/projects/products.

### Some facts about me.

- I was born in the city [Cahul, Republic of Moldova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahul).
Probably you never heard of it, but I am very proud of my roots.
- I like sports. I played basketball for more than 11 years on various levels.
I participate in marathons, even though I don't like the training. I learned
to swim at 24 years old.
- I am really into personal development. I read a lot on this subject in order
to be better at what I do and to be a better human in general.
- I know three foreign languages English, French, and Russian.
